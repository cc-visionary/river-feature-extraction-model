In this repository, we give the network weights and configuration files that 
can be used with the deeplab network developed at
https://github.com/kazuto1011/deeplab-pytorch

- The .pth files are the weight files
- The water.yaml file is a sample configuration file allowing to load our file 
  for inference
- The water_labels.txt file is a label description file necessary for the 
  inference

Those files can be used with the demo.py script from the network website.

Sample commande line:

python demo.py single \
    --config-path /path/to/water.yaml 
    --model-path /path/to/laura_2steps.pth 
    --image_path /path/to/your_image.png
